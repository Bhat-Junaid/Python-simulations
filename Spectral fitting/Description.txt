This file Practical-Work contains all the tasks that need to be done, these are realized by spectra1.f90. 
Basically this file contains all the things that the code does, both fortran and the python file.
The raw data files are spectre_1....spectre_5 and the output files are theo_wi1_spectre_1.....theo_wi2_spectre_2
Technical_Report_TP1 is the report file, this could help one further understand what the code does, besides that
the code is sufficently commented making it easier to understand.:)
